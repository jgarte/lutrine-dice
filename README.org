* Building the dev environment

** Using Docker Compose

Docker Compose has service definitions to build & run the client and server.

#+begin_src bash
docker-compose up -d
#+end_src

To re-build the server, run ~docker-compose restart server~. The client dev
server will hot-reload code when you change files, but if it gets stuck you can
~docker-compose restart client~.
